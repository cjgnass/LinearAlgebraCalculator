App.tsx : 
- Need a way to access the output expression for each Calculator component 
- The row ids and output expressions that have a Map value of true get sent to the Graph component

Graph.tsx : 
- Graph component first checks if the type of expression it receives from the row
- Depending on the type of expression it will graph the expression differently
- We are going to start by graphing 2d vectors only for now
