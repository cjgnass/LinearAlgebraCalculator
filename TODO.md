- Create Graph
- Graph needs to have a point of view that stores current position
- Graph needs to receive the rows that are toggled on 
- Graph needs to render axes and gridlines based on current position
- Graph needs to render row outputs based on current position
- Graph needs to be able to change current position based mouse dragging 
- Graph needs to change zoom by scrolling 

First I want to create a 2d graph with gridlines and axes that I can move around by dragging the mouse and zoom in and out using the scroll wheel.
